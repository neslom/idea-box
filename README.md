# idea-box

This is a project for storing and rating ideas, built with a Rails back-end, and front-end interaction fueled by JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery.

Add a new idea, upvote or downvote an idea by clicking on the appropriate thumb, edit an idea by double-clicking the idea body, and delete ideas... by clicking the delete button.
